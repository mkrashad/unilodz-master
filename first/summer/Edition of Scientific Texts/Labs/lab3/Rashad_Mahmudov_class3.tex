\section{Introduction}
\small{\justify{Curves and surfaces are usually defined with a minimum assumption like differ-entiability or rectifiability.This hypothesis seems to be natural and are useful to access to some basic properties such that the possibility to compute the length of a curve $C(t)$ between to point $C(a)$ and $C(b) : L = \int_a^b || C'(t||dt$. But what arise if these hypothesis are not verified? Is is possible to defined curves which
are no-where differentiable? Is it possible to control they geometry? The fractal theory gives numerous answers of these questions.

\setlength{\parindent}{0.5cm} This chapter is not devoted to fractal geometry and it donâ€™t give answer
to all of these questions. But it describes how it is possible to use the fractal
paradigm to design a set of curves which are not possible to describe with others
models because of the simple fact that these models made the assumption of the differentiability.}}

\section{Some math}
In this section we gives some mathematics results used in this course. Profs can
be found.
\normalsize{\paragraph{Definition 1} (Contraction). Let $(\chi,d)$ be a metric space. Let $f$ be a trans-
formation on $(\chi,d). \,\,f$ is a contraction $(\chi,d)$  iff 
$\exists s \in \mathbb{R},\, s < 1$ tq $\forall x,y \in$

$\chi,d(f(x), f(y)) \leq s\times d(x, y)$ 
\paragraph{Definition 2}(Banach Fixed Point theorem).Let $(\chi,d)$ be a non-empty com-
plete metric space and $f$ a contraction on $(\chi,d)$. Then, there exists a unique
point $x \in \chi$,named the fixed point of $f$, verifying $f(x) = x$.}

\subsection{Package enumerate}
\justify{This package gives the enumerate environment an optional argument which
determines the style in which the counter is printed. An occurence of one of the tokens A a I i or 1 produces the value of the counter printed with (respectively)

\noindent\verb|\Alph \alph \Roman \roman or\arabic|. These letters may be surrounded by any strings involving any other TEX expressions, however the tokens A a I i 1
must be inside a group if they are not to be taken as special.

\indent You have to load package \verb|enumerate| writing \verb|\usepackage{enumerate}|.}
